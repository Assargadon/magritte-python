# MagritteSQLAlchemy declarative
This was first attempt to create a declarative mapping for SQLAlchemy based on Magritte descriptions.
The implementation relied on DTO as intermediary objects for data transfer between business layer and ORM involving too many moving parts.

*Considered not final, but may be developed further.*

*Imperative mapping looks more straightforward and easier to understand and adopt in client code.*
